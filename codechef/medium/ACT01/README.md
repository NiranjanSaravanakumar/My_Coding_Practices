### Pen Shortage

Chef is organizing a classroom activity.

There are $N$ students, and each student needs exactly one pen.

### Input Format

The only line of input contains two space-separated integers $N$ and $P$.

### Output Format

### Constraints
- $1 \le P \le N \le 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
10 7
```

### Sample 2:
